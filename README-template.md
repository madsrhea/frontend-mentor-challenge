## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Visual Studio Code
- GIMP (for the abstract background)


### What I learned

Because I haven't touched HTML/CSS since I completed my _Web Development_ class over a year ago, and also decided to leave the assignment for the night before it was due, there was quite a bit of Googling and a lot of trial and error to remember what all the tags were.

But, I remembered my love of making websites (and coding in general) and remembered that, once it stops being frustrating, it starts being fun.

### Continued development

While I don't have any plans in the near future to continue working on it, I would love to come back and remake it once I'm more familiar with CSS. I know there's definitely a more efficent, less cluttered way to write the code and I'd love to compare and contrast once remaking.
